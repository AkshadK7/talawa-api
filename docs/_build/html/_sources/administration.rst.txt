Administration
==============


How To Add Administrators
-------------------------

Only the creator of an organization can add administrators. In order to make a user an administrator of an organization that user has to be a member of that organization.
After creating an organization the creator is automatically made an admin of that organization.

How To Remove Administrators
----------------------------

Only the creator of the organization can remove administrators. 


What can an Administrator do?
-----------------------------

Administratos can remove any member from an organization as long as that member is not also an administrator or the creator.
They can also remove any post made by any user, as well as any event or group chat created by members of the organization


Blocking a User
---------------
Administrators of an organization can block any user. Once blocked this user will no longer be able to join or send membership requests to the organization.
The organization will also no longer show up in the organization search results of this user.


Unblocking a User
-----------------
Administrators can unblock any user that were previously blocked by the organization. This will undo all the effects of blocking the user.
The user will now be able to join and send membership requests to the organization as well as see the organization in his organization search results.


Toggling Organization Visibility in search
------------------------------------------
Organization administrators will be able to toggle the visibility of organizations in search results. When visibility is turned off users will no longer see the organization in their organization search results.
